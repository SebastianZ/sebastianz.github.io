# JavaScript tips and tricks you should now

## Elevator Pitch

A collection of tips and tricks for JavaScript that will help you write better code and improve your workflow.

## Description

The talk will cover a bunch of tips and tricks for JavaScript developers.

Those include things that are not commonly known, but can make your life as a JavaScript developer easier.
Examples include the `matchMedia()` function for responsive design, the `Intl` object for internationalization, and the optional chaining operator `?.` for cleaner code.

## Notes

While Iâ€™ll try to explain things as detailed as possible, beginners to JavaScript probably will have a hard time to understand everything discussed. So it rather targets intermediate and advanced JavaScript authors.
